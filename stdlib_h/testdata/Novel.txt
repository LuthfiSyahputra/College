I woke up as the dazzling sunlight penetrates through a window beside my bed. ahh... my head, it hurts so much
I quickly rubs off the sleep from my eyes; it's already past noon! Damn, how did I oversleep? Wait, where am I?! Oh shit... Where am I? The room around me is unfamiliar.
I'm getting up instinctively and open the curtains on the window that blocked my view from the outside..., a quite busy town with middle-time buildings appeared before my eyes; where am I?, How come I wake up in this place?
My eyes widened when I noticed the familiar building near the docks of the harbor. My heart jumped with joy. This means that I am still in New York!
I get down from my bed and rush out the door, ignoring the sounds coming from inside.
I'm running down the stairs, rush out the building's door that looks like an old apartment. when I finally get out from the building, the outside world surprised me, this isn't familiar.., it pretty much like I go back in time.

Then instinctively, I go to the only familiar building near the docks of the harbor. I only saw an old man sitting on an old bench reading newspaper. He immediately looked at me in surprise when he heard my footsteps. "Oh hey, there you are."
"What?"
The old man smiles, "You were looking for me yesterday right? I've been waiting for you all day!"
"Pardon me, Do I know you?", I'm sure enough I never meet him before
The old man smiles again, "Ah.., sorry sorry..., you must have forgotten the incident we're going through yesterday"


The old man changes his tone, "Listen here kid.., don't trust anybody in this world, let's say.., this isn't our world, we don't belong in here"

"What do you mean?", I'm getting confused

"Anyway, this isn't the place to talk, go clean up yourself kid, and come meet me at this place tonight" the man stood up and leave the place.
After cleaning myself, I went straight to the docks of the harbor, but I couldn't find the old man. I search for him for hours until I realized that I was mistaken. I should be meeting him at the same old bench near the docks of the harbor.
I go to the old bench, the old man isn't there.
"Damn, How fool I am..", I regretting my own mistakes
Then, having a hope the old man will come back, I sit on the bench waiting him to come back.., there isn't one coming..
I leave the place regrettably, my eyes notices a small paper below the bench, I pick it up and read it..
The text almost unreadable as if it being written in rush, "BEWARE HOME, BENCH 3 DAYS"; What the hell is going on? why he left this small note? or is it even him who left this note?
I'm clueless, I put the paper in my pocket and going back to the old apartment I was first waking up..
it's still midnight and dark outside, but what is this feeling? I feels like someone trailing me behind..
It's too late, I turn around, but nothing there.
I arrived at the apartment, open the entrance door and walking upstairs to my room, not only the outside it's even darker in the apartment
but, what is this, I still feels like someone trailing me behind even in the building
I finally arrived in front of my room's door in this dark place, I suddenly remember the notes from before "BEWARE HOME..",  I quickly looking back, but there's no one in there
I strengthen my inner self and open the door to my room slowly.., there's nothing change in my room
feeling relieved, I'm going inside my room, close the door and lock it..., wait, How do I lock the door?, am I even have the key to lock it?, It's never been locked from the very start, I don't even know this place or whose room is this?, I just waking up in here without knowing anything from the past 
Anyway, I'm pretty tired from all this mysteries coming one and another.
I even haven't eat anything since I wake up from the start, I open the window curtains as brim moonlight shines through my dark room
Huh, how odd?, I'm sure I saw someone on the road, but when I look again, there isn't anyone. maybe I'm hallucinating because of how tired I am
Without thinking anything, I stretched my tired body on the bed and closed my eyes and quickly come to sleep hoping this was all just a dream.
But when I woke up next morning, the sun light peeks from the window, and I just realize that this is reality.

Burrppp~~~, my stomach growling like crazy, I realized I haven't even eat anything since yesterday
Ughh.... my body feels heavy, can't get up. I smell something and turn my head around, huh.. a basket full of breads on a wooden stool
I jump from my bed and quickly munching those freshly baked breads, ahh.. this is the most delicious food in my life. "mmhm.., mmmhm.., mmmm.."
wait, there's another?, a mug full of cream!!!. Without thinking, I just know instinctively to dip these breads inside the cream
The sweetness of the bread combined with the savory cream, creating a delightful flavour ready to sent even your soul out of this world
"Buuurrrppp...., ahh.. what a life~~" I'm full
"Mmpphh..." my throat.., I need water. I run to a sink and drink directly from the faucet, not forgetting to wash my face too
